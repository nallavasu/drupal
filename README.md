DHL DATA FETCH
====================

About this module
-----------------
DHL DATA FETCH module is about fetching the data through API created by us based on our inputs like country code, city and pincode.

In concept, any revision-aware content entity is supportable.  In core, that includes Nodes and Block Content. However,
there may be a small amount of work needed to support additional content entities due to inconsistencies in the
Entity API.core. To add custom WBM integration for your entity type, annotate your entity to specify a moderation
handler class that extends \Drupal\workbench_moderation\Entity\Handler\ModerationHandler.

Installation
------------

DHL DATA FETCH module has no special installation instructions. The default configuration that ships with the module should cover most
typical use cases, with no need to configure additional States or Transitions. You are welcome to do so, however, and
to edit or remote any pre-defined State or Transition.
